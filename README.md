Small challenges to keep us moving toward improved coding and data-habits. 

## The Rules

+ Challenges do not have to be tricky or hard - just something to interesting to learn from will do.


+ You can post a challenge in any (reasonable) language.


+ Challenges must be in text-friendly form (no word docs, pdfs, etc).


+ You don't have to know how to answer a challenge to post it.


+ Data used in a challenge must be susper easy to access (either it is built-in or you provide the necessary tools to access.)


+ Answers can be posted in the "answers" subdirectory. Use your judgement on naming the answers - so if the challenges is called "Foo-bar" name your answer "Foo-bar-maxheadroom".


+ Answers must be in text-friendly form (no word docs, pdfs, etc).


+ Challenges may be done alone, but really it's more fun to team up.


### Using github 

If you don't use github, then this is a nice low-pressure opportunity to learn ho to use it.  Just ask someone who uses it to guide you through these steps: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.
